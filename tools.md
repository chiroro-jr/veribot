# Tools used to build this application
- **Streamlit** - an open-source Python library that allows you to create web applications for data science and machine learning projects with minimal effort. It is designed to simplify the process of turning data scripts into shareable web apps.
- **Pipenv** - a command-line tool and a Python package that provides dependency management and virtual environment functionality for Python projects. It aims to simplify the process of managing project-specific dependencies, ensuring reproducibility, and creating isolated development environments.
- **Keras** - an open-source deep learning library written in Python. It serves as a high-level neural networks API, designed to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible. Keras was originally developed as an independent project but has been integrated into TensorFlow as its official high-level API since TensorFlow version 2.0
- **NLTK** - a popular open-source Python library and platform designed to work with human language data. It provides a wide range of tools, resources, and libraries for working with text and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- **Numpy** - a fundamental Python library for numerical and mathematical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Sklearn** - an open-source machine learning library for Python. It is one of the most widely used libraries for machine learning and data mining because of its user-friendly and efficient design. Scikit-learn provides a vast array of tools and functionalities for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and more.
